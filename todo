--- most of these are actions to be done on the Iframe

Dont record the record controls ---- Its not a bug, its a feature
dont record the mouse but record the cursor ---+
Add a timeline to the recording with some video controls
	map:- time = event

:: Each event is mapped with a time stamp
What I need is to be able to spread the values of the seek in accodance to the cast time
Then, sync the cast as in, when a move the seek button, the cast will adjust to the current events

On screencast click, pause
On screencast edit, save edits as cache or something -
on play, continue screencast 
------------------

what I want from it
----

To be pausable when iframe clicked ---+
To continue at the same same spot, with the same speed when play  ---+
The seek button to be synchronized with the screencast -
Don terminate iframe after play ---+

if possible fix, stop play and detach functions
